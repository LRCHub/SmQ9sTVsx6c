It's a bad habit
I can't break free
You take me over like a syndicate
'Cause the medicine I'm taking
It got me feeling like I'm sinking
We choose to believe
there's something
more than good enough
And I know that I should give it up
But tonight I'm holding on
And, it's a bad habit
I should walk away,
but I love to lick the pain cause'
I got bad habit
Tried cut the chain,
but I know it ain't the same thing
Our love's a hell
that's meant for me
Hold onto the fantasy, baby
You know I gotta have it
But it's a bad habit
Yeah, it's a bad-bad habit
Break the glass, face down,
up through the nose
One more night sweat soaked
down to the bone
To find the otherwise of the dice
I think I'll take another gamble
We choose to believe
there's something
more than relevance
You can't forgive
what's already done
So tonight I'm holding on
And, it's a bad habit
I should walk away
but I love to lick the pain cause'
I got a bad habit
Tried to cut the chain,
but I know it's not the same thing
Our love's a hell
that's meant for me
Hold onto the fantasy, baby
You know I gotta have it
But it's a bad habit
Yeah, it's a bad-bad habit
We choose to believe
Always in control
We choose to believe
It's easy till it goes
And, it's a bad habit
I should walk away,
but I love to lick the pain cause'
I got bad habit
Tried to cut the chain,
but I know it's not the same thing
Our love's a hell
that's meant for me
Hold onto the fantasy, baby
You know I gotta have it
But it's a bad habit
Yeah, it's a bad bad habit
Oh, yeah, yeah
You know I gotta have it
But it's a bad habit-habit
